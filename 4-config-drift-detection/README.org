This guide will cover configuring [[https://www.ansible.com/products/controller][Ansible Automation Controller]] with a configuration as code drift detection example. The intent of this guide is to make it easy to demonstrate the drift detection capabilities of Ansible Automation Platform.

We need to spin up demonstration environments quickly then throw them away again when finished, with this in mind we will automate our entire configuration for ansible automation controller using the [[https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/ansible/controller/][automation controller]] ansible collection.

Using this approach our entire demo configuration can be completed by running a single playbook below.

#+NAME: Configure aap as code
#+begin_src tmate
# Source secrets
source ../.env

# Create controller.cfg file
cat << EOF > controller.cfg
[general]
host=https://controller.rhdemo.win
username=admin
password=${TF_VAR_aap_password}
verify_ssl = false
EOF

# Run ansible playbook
ansible-playbook configure-aap-controller.yaml
#+end_src
