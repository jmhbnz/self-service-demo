This guide will outline the steps to follow to deploy the infrastructure required to run demonstrations. Infrastructure provisioning is performed via [[https://www.ansible.com/][ansible]] using the certified [[https://www.terraform.io/][terraform]] collection.

To run the demo we need four rhel virtual machines, these machines will run our ansible automation platform components, namely the controller, private automation hub, single sign-on, and automation services catalog.

Run the code block below to install our dependencies and run the ansible playbook that will deploy our infrastructure.
